# Redundant Section Removal - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully removed the redundant CTA section and guarantee cards from the OrderingProcess component. The elimination of "¿Lista para Crear Magia?" and the three value cards ("Compromiso del Corazón", "Promesa Sagrada", and "Excelencia Artesanal") streamlines the user experience while maintaining smooth layout flow and responsive design.

## 🗑️ Sections Removed

### ✅ CTA Section: "¿Lista para Crear Magia?"
**Removed Elements**:
- Large promotional box with inner glow effects
- Heading: "¿Lista para Crear Magia?"
- Body text about creating sweet endings
- WhatsApp CTA button: "Comenzar Nuestra Historia"
- Decorative background elements (floating circles, gradients)

**Reason for Removal**: 
This section was redundant as the storytelling flow already culminates naturally with the four-step process, and additional CTAs are available throughout the site.

### ✅ Guarantee Cards Section
**Removed Elements**:
1. **Compromiso del Corazón** card
   - HandHeart icon
   - "Tu felicidad es mi propósito..." description

2. **Promesa Sagrada** card  
   - SacredTime icon
   - "Cada fecha es un compromiso sagrado..." description

3. **Excelencia Artesanal** card
   - ArtisanChef icon
   - "Cada ingrediente es elegido como una joya..." description

**Reason for Removal**:
These values are already communicated through the storytelling narrative and don't add functional value beyond what's conveyed in the process flow.
