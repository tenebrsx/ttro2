# Instagram Images Directory

This directory contains images for the Instagram carousel component. In a production environment, these would be actual photos of desserts from the business's Instagram account.

For a complete implementation, you should replace these placeholder files with actual JPG images of the following desserts:

1. `chocolate-raspberry-tart.jpg` - A chocolate tart with fresh raspberries
2. `vanilla-caramel-macarons.jpg` - Vanilla and caramel macarons
3. `berry-cheesecake.jpg` - A cheesecake with mixed berries
4. `decorated-cookies.jpg` - Decorated butter cookies for events
5. `strawberry-cupcakes.jpg` - Vanilla cupcakes with strawberry frosting

Each image should ideally be square (1:1 aspect ratio) and at least 400x400 pixels in size for optimal display in the carousel.

The fallback image (`/images/fallback-dessert.jpg`) should also be replaced with an actual image that will be displayed if any of the Instagram images fail to load.
